I sat (and subsequently) passed the CISSP earlier this year, thus earning the associate of ISC2 status!

Such pass of the CISSP was no small feat - I carried out 140 days of study across numerious study materials to gain the confidence to go ahead and attempt the 4 hour exam.

I passed the CISSP at 145Q with around 50 minute remaining! This was my first attempt.

<h2 style="color: green;"> Studies </h2>

I started the journey November 2022 via the Destination Certification Masterclass.

The Masterclass presents the information in a way that is not even comparable to any of the other study material I had a look at.

It is a very concise course that explains exactly what you need to know in a very clear way. The course is built and presented in a way to automatically make you think like a CEO without even knowing it. Videos presented within the course range from 5-20 minutes, and each video comes with it's own written summary including easily digestible diagrams. There are multiple end-of-domain knowledge assessments which cover the most critical areas, and an end-of-class practice test.

All throughout my study towards achieving the CISSP, my tutor Lou was available for guidance via my purchase of the Destination Certification Masterclass. He was essential to my passing of the exam, and is extremely knowledgeable surrounding all things CISSP. He took great care in ensuring I was on the correct path during my studies.

<h2 style="color: green;"> Exam </h2>

I was taught to read the question 3 times, and not even look at the answers until you point out the key words to figure the answer out on your own. This stops potential answers from messing with your thinking.

Some questions required me to sit back for a moment after re-reading the question 11 times, and some questions I knew straight away the answer. I was able to easily remove 2 wrong answers.

Comprehending questions is half of the job, most of the time it wasn't even the language, or wording of the questions that made it confusing, you could understand what it's asking, but then the answers would be worded in a way that really tests your abilities to link all your knowledge together.

<h2 style="color: green;"> Verdict </h2>

It was a difficult exam. I can see how someone could know all the topics but still not pass if they don't have the perspective that ISC2 is looking for.

The exam is really a mile wide, inch deep, and will challenge you quite rigorously across all domains while using language that makes you think.

Achieving the CISSP is a very big milestone for me, and I owe it to the masterclass, and everyone in the community who sticks around to help out.
